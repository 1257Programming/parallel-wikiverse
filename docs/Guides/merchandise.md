## Overview

1257 merchandise is an important part of our team's image and how we thank our sponsors. Although it isn't hard, there are a lot of steps and it's important to keep track of deadlines.

## General Info

### Purpose
Team merchandise is part of how we promote our team image, maintain a consistent visual identity, and acknowledge our team's sponsors. It's important that at least our t-shirts are ordered each year and that each team member has a shirt to wear at team events. Merchandise other than the primary team shirt is beneficial, but not mandatory. We encourage students to have at least two shirts for improved hygiene.

### Recommended pricing
Each active team member receives one free shirt a year to ensure that finances are not a barrier to participation. Beyond that, we recommend a small markup of about $2-3 per shirt. Other merchandise may have larger markups, but be wary of making the  markups too high.

### Vendors
Our primary vendor for screenprinted merchandise is [2K Printing](http://www.2kpromotions.com/). Our primary vendor for embroidered merchandise is [Accent Apparel](http://accentapparelinc.com/).
