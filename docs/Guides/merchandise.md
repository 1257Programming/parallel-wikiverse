## Overview

1257 merchandise is an important part of our team's image and how we thank our sponsors. Although it isn't hard, there are a lot of steps and it's important to keep track of deadlines.

## General Info

### Purpose
Team merchandise is part of how we promote our team image, maintain a consistent visual identity, and acknowledge our team's sponsors. It's important that at least our t-shirts are ordered each year and that each team member has a shirt to wear at team events. Merchandise other than the primary team shirt is beneficial, but not mandatory. We encourage students to have at least two shirts for improved hygiene.

### Recommended pricing
Each active team member receives one free shirt a year to ensure that finances are not a barrier to participation. Beyond that, we recommend a small markup of about $2-3 per shirt. Other merchandise may have larger markups, but be wary of making the  markups too high.

### Vendors
Our primary vendor for screenprinted merchandise is [2K Printing](http://www.2kpromotions.com/). Our primary vendor for embroidered merchandise is [Accent Apparel](http://accentapparelinc.com/). 

## Process

### Design merchandise
Merchandise designs should be vector-based. Important considerations:
* Designs should be large, clean, and clear. If it's hard to represent as a vector graphic, it may not work well on merch. The team logo in particular should be as large as possible on the t-shirt and on plain hoodies.
* Screenprinting and embroidery both increase in price with larger sizes (particularly for embroidery) and a greater number of colors (particularly for screen printing). Unless there's a good reason, limit yourself to black, white, green, and purple.
* Avoid slightly different sizes of the same design for screen printing. Each different size is a separate set of screens, which we will be charged for.
* These are guidelines, not unbreakable rules. If you have a good reason to diverge from these recommendations, ask about it!
### Get designs approved
* No surprises coming back from the vendors, please.
### Request quotes
Request quotes as early as possible. Try to have a finished design before you get quotes, but if needed you will typically be able to make minor changes without changing the price, as long as you don't change the overall size and number of colors.
Both vendors that we work with are happy to take requests by email. Requests must be approved by a mentor and should include:
* Design files
* What we want to make (shirts, hats, hoodies, etc). If you don't know what exact model of shirts or other garments you want, the vendors can work with you to help you choose.
* Approximate quantities you think we'll sell, plus a request for what the price would be at various quantities. Each vendor will have breakpoints at which items get cheaper beyond a certain quantity.

**When you send the request for quote, please remember to include both faculty mentors as well!**
### Set pricing
* Use the quotes from the vendors and the recommended pricing guide to determine pricing. Remember that we'll need to cover shirts for sponsors as well.
### Take orders
Our current method is to use a Google Form. We are open to other methods. At a minimum, each order should contain:
* Name
* Affiliation with team
* Quantities/sizes for order
* How/when/where the order will be picked up if the person is not regularly there

**Remember to order spares and sponsor shirts**
### Request check
Request a check from a faculty mentor, who will request it from the school.
### Submit orders
Get the order approved, then submit to the vendors.
### Bundle merchandise
When the merchandise is delivered, it must be bundled by order and labeled before *anybody* is allowed to pick it up.
### Distribute merchandise
Merchandise must be paid for before it is picked up.
