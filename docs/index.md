Welcome to Parallel Wikiverse!

[FRC Team 1257](http://team1257.org/) is a [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/) team from [Union County Vocational-Technical Schools](https://www.ucvts.tec.nj.us/) in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.

Team 1257 was founded in 2004 and competed for three years before disbanding. The team returned for the 2009 season and has competed each year since then.

## What We Do
Our primary activity is competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Over the years, we've had other activities as well:
* In [Power Racing](http://www.powerracingseries.org/), we have $500 to modify children's ride-on toys and race them against competitors ranging from other high schools to professional engineers.
* We've had our own internal combat robotics challenge
* We do outreach in our community, in both STEM and non-STEM areas.
